            <p>Hello! My name is Matt Faile and I am an apprentice coder at the UMN Boot Camp. In my spare time I like
                to go for walks, go to the beach, ride bikes, play computer games or play with my daughter. I am
                currently learning to code to enhance my skills and master the language so I can help the human race win the war
                against the machines.

            </p>
            In my free time, I like to travel.  I just recently I took my daughter to a Minnesota State Park in Afton.  She likes to run it out on the trails.  We also saw a deer out in the wild!  By the end of the day, we were all very tired.  This is the conclusion of my story and about me section.
